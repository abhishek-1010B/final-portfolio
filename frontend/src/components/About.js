      <p>
        My name is Abhishek Duggal, and I am a final-year undergrad at Chitkara
        University. Currently, I am working on projects using the MERN stack
        (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and I am open to freelancing
        opportunities. I have a strong passion for full-stack web development
        and enjoy building modern applications with the latest technologies. In
        addition to my work, I have included some of my projects in the
        "Projects" section, which you can explore. I have also earned
        certifications in Machine Learning through Gemini, deepening my
        understanding of artificial intelligence and its applications.
